Hello!
If you get this assignment, that means we really like you and just want to know how much do you love to code. Don’t bother at all if you get stuck anywhere and aren’t able to finish it. Just zip your best effort towards this and send it back to us!


Problem 1:

Backend: Expose 3 apis -

1) GET countries with the path “/countries”
   This should list any 10 countries, including INDIA
2) GET state. Path should be “/:country/states”
   This should return states for that country. To make it simple, just return any 10 states for India
3) GET cities. Path should be “/:country/:state/cities”
   This should return cities for the state. To make it simple, just return 5 cities for the 10 states.

Front end: Consume the apis above. On home page, display list of countries. On clicking “India”, it should route to a new page listing the states. On clicking states, it should route to a new page listing cities for that state.

If you click any other country than India on the home page, it should redirect to a page saying “We are still working on this!”
